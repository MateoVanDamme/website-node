              | As part of my DevOps course the professor devised an online game. The class was split up
              | into teams. The game ran 24/7 and each team was given a 2-second window to make a move.
              | If their game logic service was offline the move was fortfeited. At the end of the year,
              | the teams with the highest score received some extra points on the final exam.

              | To succeed, students had to implement their game logic as a service, and ensure it was
              | resilient against "accidental" network interruptions. Our strategy focused on
              | prioritizing resiliency and failover mechanisms over complex decision-making.

              | This project required a stable and effective pipeline. After every change game logic was
              | first tested by itself with unit testing. Then, an integration test was performed to
              | ensure it could respond to incoming HTTP requests, and only if this succeeded was it
              | deployed in the production environment. Remember, if the turn was wasted, your army
              | stood still while the enemy could advance and gather resources! While our logic wasn't
              | as advanced as other teams', we still earned a good grade in the end.
              br
              br
              | The game itself and our decision-making logic were fully implemented in Java. Best
              | practices were used to create stable code that doesn't crash at runtime and can be
              | expanded easily in the future.
